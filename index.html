                        <p>Hello! I'm Jake, an aspiring software developer. I'm a self-starter, highly motivated, enthusiastic professional ready to tackle challenging projects.
                            Writing software is challenging but awesome. I believe if you want to be really good at something, you have to work at it every day.                            
                            That's why I'm always actively learning to develop and refine my skills.
                            That being said...
                            I am currently a student at devCodeCamp, a 12-week fully immersive software development bootcamp located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
                            I've had the privilege of meeting some of the most motivated, hard working, committed people during the course. I believe you become who you surround 
                            yourself with.</p>
